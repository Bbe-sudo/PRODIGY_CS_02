# PRODIGY_CS_02
Cyber Security Internship Task 2 â€“ Prodigy InfoTech
**Intern:**   Stephany
  
## Task Overview
Develop a simple image encryption and decryption tool using **pixel manipulation**. The program performs operations such as swapping pixel values or applying basic mathematical transformations to encrypt and decrypt images.

##  Objective
To understand basic concepts of image-based cryptography and how pixel-level data can be manipulated to protect visual information.

## Features
- Encrypts and decrypts image files using pixel manipulation  
- Performs mathematical operations on pixel values (e.g., addition, subtraction, XOR)  
- Supports color and grayscale images  
- Simple Python interface for user input  

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3   
- **IDE:** VS Code  

## What I Learned
How pixel values represent image data
How simple mathematical operations can be used for image encryption
Basics of file I/O and using Pillow for image manipulation
